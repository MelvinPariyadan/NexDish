## üîê 3. Set Up DVC for Dataset & Model Syncing

> ‚ö†Ô∏è The dataset and model files are stored in an AWS S3 bucket and are managed using DVC.
To access them, you‚Äôll need two secret key files, which are available in the **Project Secrets** folder on OneDrive for this project.

1. Add your provided **`.env`** file in the project root. So it will be in NexDish/.env
2. Add the provided **`config`** file in the `.dvc/` folder. So it will be in NexDish/.dvc/config. It contains the correct S3 bucket configurations.
3. Pull the dataset and model (this can take up to **30 minutes** depending on your network):

```bash
dvc pull
```
